# Introduction

This document discusses advanced uses of `gridify`, to automate the generation of multiple figures or tables.
It is recommended that you start with `vignette("gridify", package = "gridify")` and `vignette("simple_examples", package = "gridify")`, before continuing with this vignette. 

The `magrittr` and `ggplot2` packages will be useful for the examples.

```{r}
library(gridify)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Figures

In this section, we will be discussing a method to automate the generation of multiple figures for data visualization. 
The code provided below is written in R and uses the `ggplot2` and `gridify` libraries.

The process involves:

- Defining the necessary data
- Creating a function to generate each figure
- Using loops to create and save each output, with `sprintf()` to template text elements

This strategy is particularly useful when you have a large number of figures to generate that share common text elements.

### Multiple Figure Delivery with a for-loop and sprintf

When creating multiple figures at once, it can be useful to have some metadata relating to your cell text in a list to help automate the process of adding titles, footers, etc.
This could be via a dataset created in your code, or a separate file that is read in, e.g. an excel file.

In the example below, we have created some dummy metadata based on the `mtcars` dataset. 
The elements in `global` apply to all figures, the others are figure specific so have been listed individually.

```{r}
figures_data <- list(
  global = list(
    project = "My Project",
    indication = "My Indication",
    study = "My Study",
    cutoff = "Data Cut-off: YYYY-MM-DD",
    program = "program1.R",
    var1 = "mpg",
    note1 = "Note: Violin figure: compact display of continuous distribution; it is a blend of boxplot and density,
    the latter based on a Gaussian kernel estimator.",
    note2 = "Note: Placebo subjects switched to Study Drug at/after Week 16.",
    note3 = "Note: Total Study Drug includes subjects randomized to Placebo and to Study Drug.",
    note4 = "Note: N denotes the treatment population and n denotes the contributing population for
    the analysis for each treatment, parameter and visit"
  ),
  figures = list(
    figure1 = list(
      number = "1.1",
      title1 = "My title Group A",
      title2 = "My title 2",
      var2 = "wt"
    ),
    figure2 = list(
      number = "1.2",
      title1 = "My Title Group B",
      title2 = "My title 2",
      var2 = "cyl"
    )
  )
)
```

If you already have a dataset, such as an excel file, then you can process this file to get a proper list. You should add additional columns to the file to help build each figure.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)

dat <- readxl::read_excel("PATH TO YOUR FILE")
figures <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(dat)), function(row) dat[row, ])
# Optionally, you can add names to the elements of 'figures' so you won't have to subset by index later
names(figures) <- paste0("figure", seq_along(figures))
# Alternatively, you can leave the 'dat' object as it is and loop through its rows,
# or with row names if available
```

It would be helpful to create a figure-generating function with arguments that affect the elements of the output, an example of this could be:

```{r}
generate_figure <- function(data, var1, var2) {
  ggplot2::ggplot(data, ggplot2::aes(x = !!as.name(var1), y = !!as.name(var2))) +
    ggplot2::geom_line()
}
```

You want to collect all figures in a separate list. Here, the variable `figures_list` is a container for our outputs.

```{r}
figures_list <- list()
```

Optionally, set global variables, which are usually defined at the top of a script.

```{r}
COMPANY <- "My Company"
STATUS <- "DRAFT"
```

Now you can run a for-loop to generate many `gridify` objects.

```{r}
for (figure_index in seq_along(figures_data$figures)) {
  figure_obj <- generate_figure(mtcars, figures_data$global$var1, figures_data$figures[[figure_index]]$var2)

  # Add text elements using `sprintf()`
  gridify_obj <- gridify(
    object = figure_obj,
    layout = pharma_layout_A4()
  ) %>%
    # Add STATIC text elements to the `gridify` object
    # You can define these values as variables at the top of your script
    set_cell("header_left_1", COMPANY) %>%
    set_cell("watermark", toupper(STATUS)) %>%
    set_cell("header_right_2", STATUS) %>%
    # Add VARIABLE text elements to the gridify object
    set_cell("header_left_2", sprintf("%s / %s", figures_data$global$project, figures_data$global$indication)) %>%
    set_cell("header_left_3", figures_data$global$study) %>%
    set_cell("header_right_3", sprintf("%s", figures_data$global$cutoff)) %>%
    set_cell("output_num", sprintf("Output %s", figures_data$figures[[figure_index]]$number)) %>%
    set_cell("title_1", figures_data$figures[[figure_index]]$title1) %>%
    set_cell("title_2", figures_data$figures[[figure_index]]$title2) %>%
    set_cell("note", paste(figures_data$global[c("note1", "note2", "note3", "note4")], collapse = "\n")) %>%
    set_cell("footer_left", sprintf("Program: %s, %s", figures_data$global$program, Sys.time())) %>%
    set_cell("footer_right", sprintf("Page %s of %s", figure_index, length(figures_data$figures)))

  figures_list[[figure_index]] <- gridify_obj
}
```

`.Rmd` and `.Qmd` documents should be considered as alternatives for saving `gridify` objects, which can be used directly in your Rmd and Qmd documents, similar to the `gridify` package vignettes.

You can generate a PDF for each figure individually and then combine them in software like Acrobat.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!dir.exists("figures")) {
  dir.create("figures")
}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_to(
  figures_list,
  sprintf("./figures/test_Company_A4_layout_%s.pdf", seq_along(figures_list))
)
```

Or you can generate a single PDF file with all figures.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_to(
  figures_list,
  "./figures/test_multi_Company_A4_layout.pdf"
)
```

## Tables

### For PDF/DOCX

Large tables can be difficult to display on a single page, with the shrunken dimensions making them hard to read and interpret. `gridify`, in combination with the `gt` package, solves this by allowing you to split tables based on row limits, helping maintain a professional format. Here is an example of this in practice when creating outputs for pdf/docx files.

```{r}
library(gt)
```

### Splitting By Rows for PDF or DOCX

If you are dealing with an extensive table, displaying all the data on a single page can make it difficult to read. This is where splitting the table based on the number of rows is an effective solution. Let's see how this can be implemented.

First, we specify the different features we want the output to have.

```{r}
table_cols <- c("cyl", "vs", "am", "drat", "qsec") # Columns that appear in final output
df <- mtcars[, table_cols]
rows_per_page <- 10
row_height_pixels <- 10
font_size <- 12
font_type <- "serif"

number_of_rows <- nrow(df)
number_of_cols <- ncol(df)
number_of_pages <- ceiling(number_of_rows / rows_per_page)
```

Next, we divide the original data frame into smaller tables. 

```{r}
# Allocate each row to a page
df$page_number <- rep(
  1:number_of_pages,
  each = rows_per_page,
  length.out = number_of_rows
)

# Split original table into smaller pages
pages <- split(
  df,
  df$page_number
)
```

### OPTIONAL - Fill last table with empty rows

If the last table doesn't meet the `rows_per_page` specification, it will appear as if it was placed in the middle of the page.
For it to be placed at the top, the following code will add empty rows to the last table until there are `rows_per_page` rows.

```{r}
last_page <- pages[[number_of_pages]]
last_page_nrows <- nrow(last_page)
if (last_page_nrows < rows_per_page) {
  rows_difference <- rows_per_page - last_page_nrows
  append_table <- data.frame(matrix(" ", nrow = rows_difference, ncol = ncol(df)))
  colnames(append_table) <- colnames(df)
  pages[[number_of_pages]] <- rbind(last_page, append_table)
}
```

Finally, we generate each page of the output, by converting each table into a `gtable` with the `gt` package then looping over the `gridify` function. 


```{r, fig.width=7.2, fig.height=7}
results_list <- list()
for (iter in seq_along(pages)) {
  gt_input <- gt(pages[[iter]]) %>%
    tab_options(
      table.width = pct(100),
      data_row.padding = px(row_height_pixels),
      table_body.hlines.color = "white",
      page.numbering = TRUE,
      table.font.size = font_size,
      table.font.names = font_type
    )

  results_list[[iter]] <- gridify(
    gt_input,
    layout = pharma_layout_A4()
  ) %>%
    set_cell("header_left_1", "My Company") %>%
    set_cell("header_left_2", "<PROJECT> / <INDICATION>") %>%
    set_cell("header_left_3", "<STUDY>") %>%
    set_cell("header_right_1", "CONFIDENTIAL") %>%
    set_cell("header_right_2", "<Draft or Final>") %>%
    set_cell("header_right_3", "Data Cut-off: YYYY-MM-DD") %>%
    set_cell("output_num", "<Output> xx.xx.xx") %>%
    set_cell("title_1", "<Title 1>") %>%
    set_cell("title_2", "<Title 2>") %>%
    set_cell("title_3", "<Optional Title 3>") %>%
    set_cell("note", "<Note or Footnotes>") %>%
    set_cell("references", "<References:>") %>%
    set_cell("footer_left", "Program: <PROGRAM NAME>, YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM") %>%
    set_cell("footer_right", paste0("Page ", iter, " of ", number_of_pages)) %>%
    set_cell("watermark", "DRAFT")
}

print(results_list[[1]])
```

### Export To PDF, JPG and PNG

`gridify` supports three file types in `export_to()`: PDF, JPG, and PNG.

Using the result from the previous example, the first argument of `export_to()` is either your `gridify` object or a list of them, and the second is either the desired file path (including file name) or a vector of them.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!dir.exists("tables")) {
  dir.create("tables")
}
```

#### Multi-page outputs.

For multi-page outputs, PDFs are the most convenient to use. As mentioned earlier, Rmd and Qmd documents are alternatives for saving `gridify` objects, which can be saved directly into your `.Rmd` and `.Qmd` documents.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_to(
  results_list,
  to = "./tables/multipageA4.pdf"
)

export_to(
  results_list,
  to = "./tables/multipageA4portrait.pdf",
  width = 8.3,
  height = 11.7
)
```

To export as a PNG or JPG, you have two options:

#### 1. Export a single image

This is done by providing a single name for `to`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_to(
  results_list[[1]],
  to = "./tables/singlepage.png",
  width = 2400,
  height = 2000,
  res = 300
)

export_to(
  results_list[[1]],
  to = "./tables/singlepage.jpg",
  width = 2400,
  height = 2000,
  res = 300
)
```

#### 2. Export multiple images

This is done by providing a list of names for `to`. The lengths of the names vector and the `gridify` input must be the same.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_to(
  results_list,
  to = file.path("./tables", sprintf("singlepage%s.png", seq_along(results_list))),
  width = 2400,
  height = 2000,
  res = 300
)

export_to(
  results_list,
  to = file.path("./tables", sprintf("singlepage%s.jpg", seq_along(results_list))),
  width = 2400,
  height = 2000,
  res = 300
)

export_to(
  results_list,
  to = file.path("./tables", sprintf("singlepage%s.pdf", seq_along(results_list))),
  width = 2400,
  height = 2000,
  res = 300
)
```

### Extending The Multi-Page Example

In pharmaceutical and other industries, presenting tables often requires customization to meet reporting standards. While splitting by rows is a common approach for handling large datasets, it is not the only option. Here are some potential ways in which a table could be split up, where `gridify` could then be used to generate a new page for each table:

 - **Group by columns:** Create separate tables for each unique combination of selected columns, such as treatment groups, geographic regions, or product categories.
 - **Split by columns:** When dealing with wide datasets, distribute columns across multiple tables to improve readability, such as separating different performance metrics or variable types.
 - **Retain a key column:** Ensure essential identifiers (e.g., PatientID or TransactionID) appear on every page for easy reference and consistency.

These methods provide greater flexibility in structuring tables, making them easier to interpret and align with diverse reporting needs across industries.

### Long Table in HTML

When rendering a .Rmd or .Qmd document into HTML, using 'fixed' scale measurements for heights is essential to prevent excessive scrolling or content being cut off. 
Additionally, layout margins should be defined in absolute units, such as inches, cm or mm.

When trying to find the perfect `fig.width` and `fig.height` for the output, instead of guessing, you can use a binary search method to quickly find the ideal height.
Here is an example:

1. Start with a range (e.g., 20 to 120 inches).
2. Test the midpoint: Try 70 inches (the average of 20 and 120).
3. Adjust based on results:
4. If 70 inches is too tall, reduce the value to 45 inches (average of 20 and 70); if too short, increase it to 95 inches (average of 70 and 120).
6. Repeat the process

Keep refining and you will quickly find the optimal height.

The R code below has `fig.width = 8` and `fig.height = 45`.
Note that `pharma_layout_letter` is using the default heights (similar to `"fixed"` scales) and margins in `"inches"`.

```{r, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 45}
gt_obj <- gt::gt(Theoph)

g <- gridify(
  object = gt_obj,
  layout = pharma_layout_letter()
) %>%
  set_cell("header_left_1", "My Company") %>%
  set_cell("header_left_2", "<PROJECT> / <INDICATION>") %>%
  set_cell("header_left_3", "<STUDY>") %>%
  set_cell("header_right_2", "<Draft or Final>") %>%
  set_cell("output_num", "<Table> xx.xx.xx") %>%
  set_cell("title_1", "<Title 1>") %>%
  set_cell("title_2", "<Title 2>") %>%
  set_cell("note", "<Note or Footnotes>") %>%
  set_cell("references", "<References:>") %>%
  set_cell("footer_left", "Program: <PROGRAM NAME>, YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM") %>%
  set_cell("footer_right", "Page xx of nn")

print(g)
```
